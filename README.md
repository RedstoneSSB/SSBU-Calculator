## SSBU Calculator
Web based Smash Ultimate knockback calculator

### How to use it
Just input your data, the calculator will update the results when you change something

A lot of hitbox data has been ported from Smash 4 so still using KH API to load them for now, however keep in mind that some hitboxes have new base damages and might have BKB/KBG/WBKB changed, you can input move data manually as well

### Notes
Formulas are being researched and some stuff is experimental or being tested, it might not be accurate until it has been confirmed
